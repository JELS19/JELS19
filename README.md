- 🗡️🛡️🐴 Hail and well met, I am @JELS19, better known as Sir Jürgen Ethelward, at thy service.
- 📜 I seek to learn much more about the kingdom of programming and to advance mine craft to become a Lord dev.
- 📚 I am currently studying the arts of C# and Python languages.
- 💪🏻 I wish to collaborate on challenging quests wherein I may put mine knowledge to the test and support the kingdom of programming.
- 🎺 How to reach me: Thou canst send a courier with escort to the address "jurgenethelward@gmail.com". Fear not, thy courier shall return safely with his escort. :)
- 🧔🏻‍♂️ Pronouns: Sir
- 🐉 Fun fact:

** In mine leisure time, I delight in playing video games and musical instruments such as the lute, bass, drums, clavier, and violin. 
** Just as with programming languages, I am also enamored with spoken tongues: 🇺🇸 🇩🇪 🇮🇪 🇷🇺 🇹🇷 🇫🇷 🇮🇹 🇸🇦 🇸🇪 🇨🇿 🇳🇴
